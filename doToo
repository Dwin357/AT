	X - be able to append a trailer/load to a truck
	X - be able to append a load to a trailer

  (append the button to the row in question)
  (have the button specifically referance on thing it is by)
  (modify the controler logic to also create these things on mission)

  X - refactor the ajax to be more dry

  ...refactor the add passenger & add truck features to be able to work w/out ajax (survey says: this would be painful to do and disappointing if successful)

  X - get nav bar working (no clear idea of what it needs)

  X - break programs dependancy on internet (just JQuerey I think)

  X - fix the information passes which broke due to mentor refactoring
  (something in passengers I think)

  X - initiate mission
