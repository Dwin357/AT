- add model validations (double booking)

  X - add sorting feature so that
  only uncompleted missions are displayed
  missions are displayed based upon start time

  X - add default values to create mission so that

	X - be able to append a trailer/load to a truck
	X - be able to append a load to a trailer
  (generate polymorphic associations)
  (append the button to the row in question)
  (have the button specifically referance on thing it is by)
  (modify the controler logic to also create these things on mission)

- get the "add rp" feature up and running
  (figure out how to add pins to the map)
  (figure out the data type for storing this info: geo-object?)

  X - refactor the ajax to be more dry

  ...refactor the add passenger & add truck features to be able to work w/out ajax (survey says: this would be painful to do and disappointing if successful)

  X - get nav bar working (no clear idea of what it needs)

  X - break programs dependancy on internet (just JQuerey I think)

- get program working as a desktop program (shoes..?)

  X - fix the information passes which broke due to mentor refactoring
  (something in passengers I think)

  X - finish the refactoring pattern (trailers and loads I think)

- get dispatch working
  - initiate mission
  - ck in tk / passenger
  - driver miles, tk miles, tk gallons, tk oil update upon tk ck in
  - mission auto-completes when last tk cks in
