...k, so

thinking out loud
 - so I am able to make markers on the map (w/ name)
 - the next part is to figure out how to have the map spit-back grid coordinates for a rest-point selected by the user
 - the final task is the object / DB stuff

to bring up with mentor
////////////////////

 - rspec tests: a green field thing that I don't know where to start with

 - the issues with "on: :update" validation (moving_forward: in dispatch) preventing save

 - validation that cks for uniquness of a truck / soldier / trailer within the scope of a mission doesn't work (doesn't fail when it should)

 - refactor of #last_assignment_return_time in soldier

 - the order of operations / saving issues with #check_out_truck in dispatch

 - not getting the hide toggles to work in the "mission display"...
 		- ck in button should not be avaliable/visible before mission has left or after it has returned.
